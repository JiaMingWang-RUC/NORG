    tinking : check the code has no bug; check the Nci structure has no problem.

Version: v1.0.03 @ 2023.03.16
    finished: checked the code has no bug; find these bug and pass though the compiler.
    doing   : Need to Projection form ground space in (n+-1) space.

Version: v1.0.06 @ 2023.03.16
    finished: CrrltFun support Asnci; Cut the Operator's not need functions; NOW we can test if the ASNCI can calc the green.
    next do : testing in 3-band.
    tinking : check "ex-pos" that the idx and position may not the same, since the ex-pos can't be '0'? Can single-particle excited states be generated by the rank formula?

Version: v1.0.07 @ 2023.03.17
    finished: The code can running fine when only use the NORG.
    next do : Debuging...
    tinking : What's the Rank equation comes from?

    tinking : What's the Rank equation comes from?

Version: v1.0.09 @ 2023.03.21
    finished: expand(natural_cfg) finised, but the hamilton_value still has some problem didn't fixed!
    next do : using the deflection to fix the Sgm.
    tinking : What's the Rank equation comes from? How do I converge the new space's ground state to the new n+/n- subspace?

Version: v1.0.10 @ 2023.03.21
    finished: using the deflection to fix the Sgm. (may be failed)
    next do : need to find the ground state in new space.
    tinking : What's the Rank equation comes from? How do I converge the new space's ground state to the new n+/n- subspace?

Version: v1.0.11 @ 2023.03.23
    finished: git_nci_no_rank(const VecReal& ground_state, const Int ex_pos).
    next do : test this function.
    tinking : Rank equation was writting some thing wrong? why it will calc the minus number?

Version: v1.0.12 @ 2023.03.28
    finished: change the state function, use vecbool to express; add the H to save the final coefficient.
    next do : Now face the problem with the calc Green. (Hold}
    tinking : Rank equation was writting some thing wrong? why it will calc the minus number? (Hold}

Version: v1.0.13 @ 2023.03.28
    finished: fix some print out problem.
    next do : (same as prev)
    tinking : (same as prev)

Version: v1.0.14 @ 2023.03.30
    finished: add the rotation for tensor H index. (Finished the find_fullH_idx() function.)
    next do : let prgramm test find_fullH_idx() in three band.
    tinking : Thinking about the possibility of the any mistake.

Version: v1.0.15 @ 2023.04.01
    finished: Fix the code to suit the new impurity data structure(Impdata). And the code can running fine with no bug.
    next do : 1.Cross-validation in three band. 2.add in the Green calc class new 
              (project_uplwer_parical_space(const VecReal &initial_vector, const Int crtann, const Int norg_set, const Int orbit_pos_in_div))
    tinking : <!--! Should rethink about the Asnci class since we choose rotate the whole H. -->

Version: v1.0.16 @ 2023.04.02
    finished: Fixed the set_row_primeter_byimpH() function; Add the oper_value Member variable.
    next do : 1.Cross-validation in three band. 2.add in the Green calc function.
    tinking : krylov_space_size so huge what's the problem?  <!--! A:The H matirx may illed -->

Version: v1.0.17 @ 2023.04.03
    finished: Find the bug to fix problem, "the krylov_space_size so huge". Now the energy_err can decrease constantly.
    next do : 1.add in the Green calc function.
    tinking : How to realize teh Green calc function? <!--! A:Using the for formula straight-->

Version: v1.0.18 @ 2023.04.04
    finished: fix the H matrix n_sC^+_iC_j term.
    next do : 1.add in the Green calc function.
    tinking : Only consider the n_s in one-set, is right? <!--! A:Yes, since the rotation wouldn't happened in different sets-->

Version: v1.0.19 @ 2023.04.04
    finished: Finished the Green calc function; Update the code from v4.1.20; Add the Green calc function(not tested).
    next do : 1.Cross-validation in three band(with interaction and no interaction).
    tinking : How should I add the correction vector for fixing the G calc?

Version: v1.0.20 @ 2023.04.05
    finished: Fix the set_interaction() in impurity class; Change the Impdata data structure; speed up the set_row_primeter_byimpH() function;
    next do : Test the convergence of ground state calc.
    tinking : The Green calc need to fixed for some structure can't find in the sub-space.

Version: v1.0.21 @ 2023.04.06
    finished: Debug for the state class; change for the abge in norg.cpp.
    next do : (same as prev)
    tinking : (same as prev)

Version: v1.0.22 @ 2023.04.06
    finished: fix the if_norg_imp mode, Now debug in this mode.
    next do : try to find the reason energy different with v1.0.07.
    tinking : The number of elerment is same as v1.0.07?
