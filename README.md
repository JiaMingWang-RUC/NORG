# NORG
The version of NORG for ZEN

Version: v1.0.01 @ 2023.03.14
    finished: the NC space construct.
    doing   : the NC space Hop;{find_h_idx(const Asnci& nc)}.
    tinking : how to get the projection form ground space in (n+-1) space. 

Version: v1.0.02 @ 2023.03.15
    finished: finish nc.find_h_idx(); fix the bug for the hamilton_value; fix the cfg2nums() function.
    doing   : Need to Projection form ground space in (n+-1) space. 
    tinking : check the code has no bug; check the Nci structure has no problem.

Version: v1.0.03 @ 2023.03.16
    finished: checked the code has no bug; find these bug and pass though the compiler.
    doing   : Need to Projection form ground space in (n+-1) space. 
    tinking : need to change the Nci structure, since the compiler's warning.

Version: v1.0.04 @ 2023.03.16
    finished: resit the Nci's structure, so no compiler's warning now.
    next do : Need to Projection form ground space in (n+-1) space. 
    tinking : is it fine not to build the H in (n \pm 1) subspace?

Version: v1.0.05 @ 2023.03.16
    finished: finished Projection form ground space in (n+-1) space. And make some cleaning.
    next do : Let CrrltFun support Asnci.
    tinking : Is it fine Operator construct nor use scsp's info, and if it's fine not to check the nppso?

Version: v1.0.06 @ 2023.03.16
    finished: CrrltFun support Asnci; Cut the Operator's not need functions; NOW we can test if the ASNCI can calc the green.
    next do : testing in 3-band.
    tinking : check "ex-pos" that the idx and position may not the same, since the ex-pos can't be '0'? Can single-particle excited states be generated by the rank formula?
